# Baseball Manager

This is a mock project for CSC325 : Advanced Object Oriented Programming

## Proposal:

### Big Picture: 
An all in one management suite for baseball teams.

### In Depth:

I want to make a mock management software for a baseball team. On first time startup, it would have 
the user configure a team and a name, as well as some basic information, such as active members of the ball
club, yearly budget, previous rankings etc. All of this would be saved in a **settings** file. Then, the manager 
would be able to add new players, send players to the IL/SL, plan games, plan starters, negotiate contracts etc.

## Feature Suite

A comprehensive list of features to be added to the software is as follows:

### Game Day Management:
The manager will also be able to manage game-day information, such as a starting lineup, planned pitching relief, and 
designated hitters. Also, the manager will have access to stats on every player, so they can make a well-informed decision at a game.

### Game Management:
The maneger will be able to see statistics regarding games, and will be able to make internal notes regarding a game.
This ties hand in hand with **Game Day Management**
