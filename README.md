# Baseball Manager

This is a mock project for CSC325 : Advanced Object Oriented Programming

## Proposal:

I want to make a mock management software for a baseball team. On first time startup, it would have 
the user configure a team and a name, as well as some basic information, such as active members of the ball
club, yearly budget, previous rankings etc. All of this would be saved in a **settings** file. Then, the manager 
would be able to add new players, send players to the IL/SL, plan games, plan starters, negotiate contracts etc.

### Big Picture : 
An all in one management suite for baseball teams.
